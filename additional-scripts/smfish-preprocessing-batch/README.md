# smFISH preprocessing batch

### Set up:
* Requirements and initial set up at:
    - `./smFISH-images-quantification/How to use - quantification of smFISH images.pdf`
    - `./smFISH-images-quantification/README.md`
* Copy the scripts provided here to the MATLAB folder (usually located in Documents directory).
    - Note: overlapping code scripts from other quantifications do not need to be replaced.

### How to use:
- Type in the command window:<br>
    - For analysis in batch:<br>`edit smFISH_preprocessing_script_batch`
    - For inter-experiments normalization:<br>`edit smFISH_preprocessing_script_batch_normalized`
    - To analyze one image:<br>`edit smFISH_preprocessing_Script` (location: `./smFISH-images-quantification/scripts_smFISH_quantification`)
- Press enter.
- Then, default values can be manually modified.
